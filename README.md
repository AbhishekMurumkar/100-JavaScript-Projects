# 100-JavaScript-Projects
Build 100 projects in JavaScipt to be proficient in language.


## Goal

1. Learn programming thinking via JavaScript.
2. Learn enough React to build your own demo app for your work project.
3. Learn Node; be able to build your own tooling for front-end architecture.


## The Rules

1. I will do 100 small Javascript exercises.
2. There's no time limit on how long an individual exercise can take.
3. I'll post both failed attempts as well as the finished attempt. I will also take notes about where I get stuck.
4. I will ask for help when I need itâ€”before I look at the answers/solution, if available.
